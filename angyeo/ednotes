QUESTIONS FOR LARRY

cron task - every 1 or 5 minutes - queue up on hourly basis to spread out people across hour
or request animation frame, but cron probably better
- best way to show most popular articles since last login? popularity of link, article or topic for a time frame? 
  - tweets, likes, pagerank,
