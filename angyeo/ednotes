QUESTIONS FOR LARRY
- Best way to periodically check for updates (so that we can send email updates)? setinterval?


first thing on page load is check if valid user logged in
change response so ang knows what to render

Goal - help entrepreneurs or VCs follow companies/sector
JTBD - i need to know when things happen to companies or similar companies

user flow
- log in
- enter in sector(s)
- enter company names
- suggest similar companies
- show profile of company
- allow user to follow
for followed companies:
- email when TC article appears or twitter mention
custom view
- news about companies or similar companies since last login
- just investments/financings vs other
